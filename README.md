## Why are you interested in this field/domain?
- We are interested in this domain because we:
    - Want to contribute to global equity initiatives through data analysis.
    - Are students and through our experiences, want to identify opportunities to make the experience better for future students, particularly for younger age groups.
    - Want to identify discrepancies to find potential solutions to mitigate educational gaps and barriers, specifically through the lens of literacy.

Education has been a significant part of our lives so far and has shaped who we are today. Through our experiences, we have seen disparities we want to identify through objective means rather than subjective to provide a basis for initiatives towards global educational equity. The first step in this process is to illustrate the extent of past and present educational gaps and barriers. From this information, we also hope to identify how COVID-19 could have potentially exacerbated these disparities.

## What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

- [The Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University](https://edopportunity.org/)
      - The Stanford Opportunity Project is an initiative aimed at harnessing data to help scholars, policymakers, educators, and parents learn how to improve educational opportunities for all children. It includes a range of detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes in school districts and counties across the United States. It includes measures of academic achievement and achievement gaps for school districts and counties, as well as district-level measures of racial and socioeconomic composition, racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system.
- [Education Fiscal Data Project](https://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Finance-and-Funding/Finance-Related-Data/Education-Fiscal-Data-Project)
      - The Education Fiscal Data project is led by the Ohio Department of Education. They work with school districts and entities that serve school districts to develop and deploy analytical tools that allow districts and other stakeholders to analyze more thoroughly district spending patterns in order to promote more effective and efficient use of resources. The outputs of these efforts - reports and documents - are designed to better understand and subsequently improve the collection and use of financial data by school districts.
- [The To&Through Project](https://toandthrough.uchicago.edu/)
      - In collaboration with educators, policymakers, and communities, the To&Through Project aims to significantly increase high school and post-secondary completion for under-resourced students of color in Chicago and around the country by providing education stakeholders with research-based data on students’ educational experiences and facilitating dialogue on its implications for adult practice.

## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

- We want to answer:
    - How large are the disparities in both quality and quantity of education across the world?
    - How do cultural differences and/or local policies impact access to education?
    - How has participation in education changed over time for different countries?
    - How has COVID-19 affected students’ ability to learn?

**Source 1 - Worldwide PISA Reading Performance vs. Investment in Education**
- _Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?_
  - [PISA: Mean Performance on the Reading Scale](https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education)
- _How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily) the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?_
  - The “Programme for International Student Assessment” (PISA) gathered the data hosted by the “World Bank”. This data presents the relationship between PISA reading outcomes and average education spending per student, splitting the sample of countries by income levels. It was generated by comparing the average reading performance scores in PISA from the source with cumulative expenditure on education, public domain data categorized as USD converted using purchasing power parity (PPP).

  - [Our World in Data - Children Not in School](https://ourworldindata.org/children-not-in-school)
- _How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?_
  - This data identifies the children out of school by the number of primary-school-age children not enrolled in primary or secondary school internationally. The number of out-of-school children is calculated by subtracting the number of primary school-age children enrolled in primary or secondary school from the total population of the official primary school-age children. The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).
  - This data was collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011. Population data are drawn from the United Nations Population Division. Using a single source for population data standardizes definitions, estimations, and interpolation methods, ensuring a consistent methodology across countries and minimizing potential enumeration problems in national censuses.
